# ARDUINO-CLASS-ATTENDANCE

 Let's understand the working of our project. As I mentioned, it helps to monitor how 
many students have entered or left the class and then accordingly marks the attendance. 
1. IR Sensor Detection: The IR sensor will glow green as soon as a student enters or 
exits the class, indicating movement. 
2. Attendance Marking: The students carry an RF ID card, which they scan while 
entering the class. If the ID is valid, the student's attendance is marked on an Excel 
sheet, recording their name and registration number. 
3. Classroom Monitoring: The number of students inside the class is displayed on the 
LCD screen. If no student is present, the LED will glow red, signaling that the 
classroom is empty. 
4. Access Control: If an RF ID card is found to be incorrect, access will be denied, 
ensuring security and preventing unauthorized entry.

Thank you for taking the time to review the report on my project. I hope this information 
provides a comprehensive understanding of the components, their technical details, and how 
they work together to monitor attendance and control access. If you have any further 
questions, please don't hesitate to ask.
